  abstract="Data stream mining is an emergent research area that aims at
  extracting knowledge from large amounts of continuously generated data.
  Novelty detection (ND) is a classification task that assesses if one or a set
  of examples differ significantly from the previously seen examples. This is an
  important task for data stream,as new concepts may appear,disappear or
  evolve over time. Most of the works found in the ND literature presents it as
  a binary classification task. In several data stream real life problems,ND
  must be treated as a multiclass task,in which,the known concept is composed
  by one or more classes and different new classes may appear. This work
  proposes MINAS,an algorithm for ND in data streams. MINAS deals with ND as a
  multiclass task. In the initial training phase,MINAS builds a decision model
  based on a labeled data set. In the online phase,new examples are classified
  using this model,or marked as unknown. Groups of unknown examples can be used
  later to create valid novelty patterns (NP),which are added to the current
  model. The decision model is updated as new data come over the stream in order
  to reflect changes in the known classes and allow the addition of NP. This
  work also presents a set of experiments carried out comparing MINAS and the
  main novelty detection algorithms found in the literature,using artificial
  and real data sets. The experimental results show the potential of the
  proposed algorithm.",

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) allows large amounts and variety of
  devices to connect,interact and exchange data. The IoT network creates
  numerous opportunities for novel attacks that can compromise information and
  systems integrity. Intrusion detection systems have been studied over two
  decades,mostly employing traditional data mining and machine learning
  techniques that require an offline phase for model training on large amounts
  of data. This paper presents three data stream novelty detection techniques
  applied to the intrusion detection problem and proposes IDSA-IoT,a novel
  implementation architecture,which combines the use of resources at the edge
  of the network and a public cloud. After an extensive empirical evaluation,
  results show that it is possible to identify new attack patterns soon after
  their emergence and to adapt the models in an efficient way.},

  abstract="Existing machine learning solutions for network-based intrusion detection cannot maintain their reliability over time when facing high-speed networks and evolving attacks. In this paper,we propose BigFlow,an approach capable of processing evolving network traffic while being scalable to large packet rates. BigFlow employs a verification method that checks if the classifier outcome is valid in order to provide reliability. If a suspicious packet is found,an expert may help BigFlow to incrementally change the classification model. Experiments with BigFlow,over a network traffic dataset spanning a full year,demonstrate that it can maintain high accuracy over time. It requires as little as 4% of storage and between 0.05% and 4% of training time,compared with other approaches. BigFlow is scalable,coping with a 10-Gbps network bandwidth in a 40-core cluster commodity hardware."
