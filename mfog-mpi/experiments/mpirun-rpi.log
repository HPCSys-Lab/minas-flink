   -report-bindings|--report-bindings 
                         Whether to report process bindings to stderr
   --report-uri <arg0>   Report this process' uri on indicated pipe
-s|--spin                Have the orted spin until we can connect a debugger
                         to it
   --set-sid             Direct the orted to separate from the current
                         session
   --singleton-died-pipe <arg0>  
                         Watch on indicated pipe for singleton termination
   --test-suicide <arg0>  
                         Suicide instead of clean abort after delay
   --tmpdir <arg0>       Set the root for the session directory tree
   -xterm|--xterm <arg0>  
                         Create a new xterm window and display output from
                         the specified ranks there

For additional mpirun arguments, run 'mpirun --help <category>'

The following categories exist: general (Defaults to this option), debug,
    output, input, mapping, ranking, binding, devel (arguments useful to OMPI
    Developers), compatibility (arguments supported for backwards compatibility),
    launch (arguments to modify launch options), and dvm (Distributed Virtual
    Machine arguments).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE was unable to reliably start one or more daemons.
This usually is caused by:

* not finding the required libraries and/or binaries on
  one or more nodes. Please check your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  settings, or configure OMPI with --enable-orterun-prefix-by-default

* lack of authority to execute on one or more specified nodes.
  Please verify your allocation and authorities.

* the inability to write startup files into /tmp (--tmpdir/orte_tmpdir_base).
  Please check with your sys admin to determine the correct location to use.

*  compilation of the orted with dynamic libraries when static are required
  (e.g., on Cray). Please check your configure cmd line and consider using
  one of the contrib/platform definitions for your system type.

* an inability to create a connection back to mpirun due to a
  lack of common network interfaces and/or no route found between
  them. Please check network connectivity (including firewalls
  and network routing requirements).
